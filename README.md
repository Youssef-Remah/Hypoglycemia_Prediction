# Hypoglycemia Prediction (GlyCare) App

## Project Overview
This project presents the development of an intelligent real-time hypoglycemia prediction system designed to enhance diabetes management by providing accurate and timely predictions of hypoglycemic events. The system integrates deep learning algorithms within a mobile application that interacts with wearable devices, such as Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) sensors and smartwatches, to collect real-time data on glucose levels, insulin dosages, physical activity, and sleep patterns.

## Project Objectives
- **Develop an AI Model for Hypoglycemia Prediction:** Create an advanced AI model capable of predicting the risk of hypoglycemic episodes for individual patients with T1D.

- **Seamless Integration of Sensor Data:** Integrate data from the "Libre 2" glucose monitoring sensor, smartwatches, and sleep tracking sensors to provide a comprehensive and real-time view of the user's health status.

- **Accurate Predictions of Nocturnal Hypoglycemic Events:** Implement AI and Deep Learning algorithms to enable accurate real-time predictions, specifically focusing on nocturnal hypoglycemic events.

- **Mobile Application Development:** Develop an intuitive mobile application using Flutter, delivering timely alerts, personalized insights, and educational content to users.

- **Proactive Management of Type 1 Diabetes:** Ensure the system empowers individuals with T1D to proactively manage their condition through real-time alerts and user-friendly features.

## Features
- **Real-time Data Collection:** Interacts with CGM sensors and smartwatches to collect real-time data on glucose levels, insulin dosages, physical activity, and sleep patterns.

- **AI-Powered Predictions:** Utilizes Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) networks to predict hypoglycemic events with high accuracy.

- **User-friendly Mobile Application:** Provides timely alerts, personalized insights, and educational content through an intuitive mobile application developed with Flutter.

## Technology Stack
- **Mobile Development:** Flutter

- **Backend:** Firebase Firestore

- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Technology:** For wireless connections with CGM sensors and fitness trackers

- **AI Model Deployment:** TensorFlow Lite
